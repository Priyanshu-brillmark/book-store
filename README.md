## Data Storage

### Books Data (`src/data/books.json`)

All product information is stored in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Book Title",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "price": 12.99,
  "description": "Book description",
  "isbn": "978-0-123456-78-9",
  "stock": 25,
  "image": "image-url",
  "category": "Fiction",
  "publicationDate": "2023-01-01"
}
```

### Orders Data (`src/data/orders.json`)

Orders are saved dynamically when customers complete checkout:

```json
{
  "id": 1234567890,
  "date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "items": [...],
  "customer": {...},
  "total": 25.98
}
```

**Note**: Since this is a static React app, admin changes are stored in localStorage. For production use, consider migrating to a backend API.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `build/` directory.

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

3. **Update homepage** in `package.json`

   ```json
   "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/book-store"
